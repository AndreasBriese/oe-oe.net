notice:
secret image funcionality is not included in this commit.
security: secret images are converted from the originally chosen image-file into 350x320px images of a particular blob format and the blob is sended like other file blobs using the salsa20/20 stream cipher. functionallity is running stable and secure but we will further improve compression before publishing the code here.
